# ME433-Advanced-Mechatronics
This repository is set for the Advanced Mechatronics course, ME 433 in Northwestern Univerisity in 2025.

The Assignment 1 is focusing on the basic use of github.

The Assignment 2 is a entry level led project with periphrial interrupt service.

The Assignment 3 is a project combining usb CDC, GPIO, and ADC to perform a voltage sensor CUL.

The Assignment 4 is a project talking to the dac to generate a 2 Hz sin wave and a 1 Hz triangle wave simultaneously with spi as the communication protocol.

The Assignment 5 is a project using SPI as the protocol to communicate 2 devices, a Dac and a RAM. fill 1000 sample points into RAM first, then read from RAM and write to dac to create a sin wave.

The Assignment 6 is a project using I2C to communicate with a I/O Expander, read from one specific input pin and control the logic level of another output pin using SPI to overwrite its logic value in register.

The Assignment 7 is a project using I2C to control a oled screen to display the voltage information measured by an analog-to-digital converter.

The Assignment 8 is a project using PIO to send specific signal to control the ws2812 addressable led series, and PWM periphrial to control a servo motor.

The content will be implemented as the course processes.
